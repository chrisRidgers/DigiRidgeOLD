As I write this I'm flicking between 6 different things:
this website, learning Octopress, learning ruby, university project A,
university project & and Season 1 of Game of Thrones.  It is 01:46 in the
morning and I have a Doctors appointment at 09:00: this is my life...

<!-- more -->

... and it's in bits.

This site is (hopefully) going to turn into a fair representation of who I am,
offering potential employers/ anyone a deeper look into my life then can be 
fairly represented on a C.V.  Part of this however means juggling several
very different things at once; this site represents the face of my first foray
into Cloud PaaS' as well as my first time publicly promoting my work which until
now I've always been contented to keeping to myself.

I've linked my Github account which documents a fair chunk of the things I do, and 
as this site pulls together, I'll include some of the other pieces of work I've enjoyed
completing; it's quite an eclectic mix, not least because since my college days my 
general attitude has been 'do everything.'  As much as the idea of specialising into an
area of computing sounds attractive, I can't help but feel a sense of unease at the 
thought that by doing so I'll limit my ability to complete a fully polished piece of work.

Such is the point of teams though is it not?  I have my own thoughts on this that I'll 
almost definitely talk about in a later post, but for now, this will suffice for a first post.

It's something that I can look and smile at.  A starting point for what I hope to be a very 
satisfying project.

Projects.... Game of Thrones..... Bed.....

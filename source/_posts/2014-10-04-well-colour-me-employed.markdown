I've just finished my first week working at 
[Studio Mashbo](http://studiomashbo.com "Studio Mashbo") and for the first time 
in nearly 2-3 weeks I've had a chance to just sit down and breathe.  True 
financial independence is within arms reach, all I have to do is the thing that 
I've just spent 3 years studying and obtained a degree in.  No problem?

After graduation and the cleanup of bits and bobs from university, I'd moved 
back to Rhewl where there was complete lack of train travel and a restrictive 
bus transport system.  I had planned to find a job before committing to such 
expenses as rent, water, elecky etc. but suddenly I was faced with this 
logistical nightmare; if I got an interview, how on earth would I get to it?
Let alone that first week of work assuming I got the position.

After much pestering from Sam and scraping of funds from various savings, we 
arrived in Liverpool:  Jobless, bedless (but not homeless) and scared !@#?less.
We were in the undesirable predicament of no income and bills to pay;  Sure I'd 
paid our 6 months rent in advance, but the master plan consisted of *"...the 
bills can come out of my overdraft and in the mean time I'll get a job..."*

Not the most wonderful of plans I'll admit however three years on a campus 
university has meant that driving lessons were never particularly high on my 
priorities list.  Sure I can see the value of a driving licence but I simply had
 other things to spend my money on.  Like food.

Sam, assuming the role of worry-er, soon tired of my lack of progress in the 
graduate job market and issued me an ultimatum; get a job before the 2 month 
mark or start applying to part time temporary roles in other sectors such as 
retail and service (a part of my life that I have long since considered over).

Then Mashbo happened.  And it happened quick.  I stumbled across a job listing 
for a Junior PHP developer on their blog.  Appreciating the "feel" the website 
gave me and their recent involvement with [CALM][1] I decided that despite a 
distinct lack experience with PHP I was going to apply anyway.  It also helped 
that I had some basic experience with some of the more extra-curricular 
requirements for the role; notably SASS and Git.  If you're not already, start
using Git immediately.  You will only benefit.

Very soon after I was asked to come into an interview, which I (quite correctly)
 put back as far as possible to give me time to review everything I could in 
preparation for the role.  I was in regular contact with the studio, requesting 
some direction in terms of reading for the technologies they used in their day 
to day work.

The interview itself went rather well.  I inevitably had to admit that my PHP 
skills were rather lacking.  But overall it seemed that they were much more 
interested in who I was, rather than how well I knew any particular language.

Half a week later I was being offered the role. Oh holy luftwaffles.  

Then came the horrible realisation that I am now employed to develop public 
facing web applications.  In PHP. And I know nothing.

The [Dunning-Kruger Effect][2] is this wonderfully horrible psychology effect 
where your study and experience of a domain leads you to realise how much 
material there is that you don't know.  Practically this is quite useful, it 
opens up the doors for future research and learning, points you in a multitude 
of directions for self development.  But in regards to the here and now?  It's 
pretty bad.  Imagine going into an interview for a role with only an awareness 
of how much stuff you don't know, and that you know enough to know that chances 
are you need to know most of it in order to effectively carry out the role 
you're interviewing for.  Got that?  Now imagine you get the role and suddenly 
you're being paid thousands of pounds a year to do the thing that you know you 
don't know enough about to do.  There's no time for research and learning: you 
start next week.  Pass me the paper bag I'm about to be sick.

Well a week and half later and I've not been fired.  I'm still painfully aware 
of the holes in my brain, but now I'm working pretty much none stop to fill 
them.  To not let the team down, to feel like I've earned my wage, to not be the
 guy that came into an interview and cheated his way into a position he 
didn't deserve. It's been a cracker of a week, but that's for another post.  For
 now I'm happy just to have gotten to my first weekend without breaking 
something.  That I know of... I should probably get back to my studies.

Not just the avid computer nerd I spend a significant  amount of my time 
carrying heavy rucksacks up and down hills.  It's a brilliant way to keep fit; 
 beats the pants out of your average gym membership and you get some cracking 
views along the way.

I'm lucky enough to be situated less than an hour away from the North Wales
Clwydian hill range, and an hour more from the west Welsh cost, Snowdownia, the
Lake District, and the Peak District.  I've also found myself up on the 
Yorkshire peaks on occasion as well.

I'll be setting up a gallery on this site to show off some of the stuff I do,
it's not all work and no play after all, as I think it's important that even
podgy computer scientists like myself keep in some form of shape; life's just
better without hot pockets and cheese filling your arteries.

My partner is an avid hill walker as well (so expect her face to crop up here 
and there), and we've recently taken on the challenge of raising some hard 
earned dosh for charity.  If you're interested in donating, the best place to do
 so would be at the Virgin Money Giving page 
[here](http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/team/gnd).

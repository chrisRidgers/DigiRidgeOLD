##Fireman
{{ 'fireman' | image_list}}

First ever character model in 3D! College assignment while studying video games 
development.  Modelled, rigged and posed in 3DSMax 2009 and textured using 
Photoshop.  Inspired by characters Psycho Mantis (Metal Gear Solid) and the 
atmosphere of 'The Suffering' by Surreal Software.


##Grunt (from video game 'Halo' by Bungie) WIP
{{ 'grunt' | image_list}}

Originally modelled in 3DSMax 2009 as part of a college assignment, this is 
currently being remoddled within Blender as part of a personal project to take a
 character from conception through to real time rendering and animation.
  Target platform for the project is an [OGRE](http://www.ogre3d.org) 
application.
